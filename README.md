# OKIDOS-NEW-APP -----!Please Read!-----

Fully Working Integrated App is in the InteGratedAPP_Final Branch.
https://github.com/EshanLekamge/OKIDOS-clothing-store-android-app-MAD-project-/tree/InteGratedAPP_Final

Due to a problem of my AVD (Emulator) the app crashed. After reinstalling a new AVD the app started working fine.
The problem occured because the AVD memory cannot run the program because too much memory usage.

This was the exception occured when running the app- I/Choreographer: Skipped 54 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.

Problem of the AVD - "Emulator error: This AVD's configuration is missing a kernel file" and "Emulator can't find 'Linux version ' string in kernel image file"


After installing a new AVD and SDK Tools app started working fine.
I wasn't able to test the app before 11.55pm  on 4th, October 2020. So, I pushed the fully integrated version to the InteGratedAPP Branch -https://github.com/EshanLekamge/OKIDOS-clothing-store-android-app-MAD-project-/tree/InteGratedAPP_Final

I Integrated and pushed the Login, Shopping Cart and Order to the origin/master
Only the admin part was not in the origin/master.
